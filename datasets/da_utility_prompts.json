Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "Identify two potential benefits of using the following technology.\n\nRobots", "Design an AI algorithm to improve the process of predicting stock prices", "Suggest two different usages of a GPT model.", "Categorize the following sentence as either an observation, inference, or evaluation\n\nThat movie was terrible.", "Write an algorithm that will calculate the average of two numbers.", "Order the following 3 numbers from biggest to smallest.\n\n2, 5, 9", "Given a list of cities, classify each city as either a developed or developing city.\n\nSydney, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo", "You are given an example sentence, provide two synonyms for one of the words.\n\nHe ate the delicious cake.", "Translate the following sentence into Spanish: \"May I have a cup of coffee?\".", "Rewrite the paragraph in reverse order\n\nAI has changed the way that many of us view the world.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "Make a list of five verbs that match with the following word.\n\nSwim", "Create a storyboard for a short film about a cat.\n\nThe short film is about a cat that was left behind in a city during a zombie apocalypse.", "How might you go about teaching a child the concept of multiplication?", "Tune a 6-string acoustic guitar.", "Detect errors in a procedure or algorithm\n\nIf there is a number greater than five, subtract one from it.", "Transform this sentence into a negative one: She loves reading books.", "Given two numbers, write a python code to calculate their sum.\n\nx = 7\ny = 4", "Could you please predict the next five words in the sentence?\n\nShe was so proud", "Follow the given input and generate two adjectives for describing a person\n\nQuirky", "Name three plants that require full sun.", "Construct an HTML page with a single heading", "Provide an example of an idiom with its definition.", "Generate a sentence of poignant and graceful prose.", "Provide a set of coordinates for the following city: Shanghai, China.", "We need to create a unique and memorable tagline for a special event.

Likewise, biodiversity loss describes the decline in the number, genetic variability, and variety of species, and the biological communities in a given area. This loss in the variety of life can lead to a breakdown in the functioning of the ecosystem where decline has happened.\nbiodiversity loss\nbiodiversity loss\n\nThe idea of biodiversity is most often associated with species richness (the count of species in an area), and thus biodiversity loss is often viewed as species loss from an ecosystem or even the entire biosphere (see also extinction). However, associating biodiversity loss with species loss alone overlooks other subtle phenomena that threaten long-term ecosystem health. Sudden population declines may upset social structures in some species, which may keep surviving males and females from finding mates, which may then produce further population declines. Declines in genetic diversity that accompany rapid falls in population may increase inbreeding (mating between closely related individuals), which could produce a further decline in genetic diversity.", "Generate a phrase using the words \"automated,\" \"assistants,\" and \"future.\"", "Explicate the Causes and Effects of World War II.", "Name the 3rd declension noun in the sentence.\n\nPersuasionem invitarunt mihi.", "Select the sentence that has the correct capitalization.\n\nA) i love reading books\nB) I Love Reading Books\nC) I love Reading Books", "Take this math equation, and explain what it means in layman's terms.\n\n2x + 3y = 4z", "Summarize the main argument of the following blog post:\n\nThis post will discuss the implications of facial recognition on our personal privacy and its far-reaching implications.", "List the four most important components for designing a successful website.", "Suggest two words to rhyme with the given word.\n\nSky", "Rewrite this mathematical equation using the version of algebraic expressions.\n\n4x + 6 = 20", "Write a persuasive essay on why people should get a pet.", "Match each city with its state.\n\n- Chicago, IL\n- Sacramento, CA\n- Wichita, KS", "Generate a metaphor that compares ambition to an animal.", "Generate a list of activities for a group of five people.", "Generate a list of recommendations to improve the given website.\n\nwww.example.com", "Classify this statement: Dogs are better pets than cats.", "Create a blog post about the importance of having a fitness routine.", "Summarize the article \"The Benefits of Eating Organic Food.\"\n\nThe Benefits of Eating Organic Food", "Edit the following sentence to ensure it is grammatically correct and properly punctuated.\n\nThe town was founded in the 1700s", "Put together a short commercial ad inspired by the following quote: \"A dream is just a wish your heart makes.\"", "Change the following sentence from a statement to a question.\n\nJohn does not understand the assignment.", "Create a data structure for the given data.\n\nA list of notes from a college biology class", "Summarize the information into 4 sentences.\n\nTwitter is one of the most popular social media platforms, with millions of users.

When the planet radiates the heat back out as infrared radiation, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb some of the heat and then radiate some of it back down towards the planet, warming it.[1][2][3] Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average surface temperature would be about \u221218 \u00b0C (\u22120.4 \u00b0F)[4][5] compared to Earth's actual average surface temperature of approximately 14 \u00b0C (57.2 \u00b0F).[6] In addition to the naturally present greenhouse gases, human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are trapping greater amounts of heat.[7][8] Burning fossil fuels has increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels, which is the primary driver for global warming.[9]\r\n\r\nMatter radiates energy at a wavelength related to its temperature. The Sun is about 5,500 \u00b0C (9,930 \u00b0F), so it emits most of its energy in near infrared and visible wavelengths (as sunlight). The Earth's average surface temperature is about 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), so it emits longer-wavelength infrared radiation (radiated heat).[8] Different gases absorb different wavelengths of radiation. Earth's atmosphere is made of gases that are transparent to visible wavelengths of light, allowing sunlight through to heat the surface. Most gases in the atmosphere are also transparent to infrared radiation, but a small proportion of the atmosphere is made up of greenhouse gases that absorb it. These greenhouse gas molecules absorb some of the heat the Earth emits and then re-emit the heat in all directions, passing it to the surrounding air and warming other greenhouse gas molecules. Heat radiated downwards further increases the temperature of the surface, which then returns heat to the atmosphere in a positive feedback cycle.\r\n\r\nA runaway greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere through a positive feedback cycle to such an extent that they substantially block radiated heat from escaping into space, thus preventing the planet from cooling.[10] A runaway greenhouse effect involving carbon dioxide and water vapor appears to have occurred on Venus. However, it is unlikely that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions alone could trigger a runaway effect on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe term greenhouse effect comes from a flawed analogy to greenhouses. The primary way greenhouses retain energy from the sun is by preventing the movement of air (blocking convection), although their panels also retain heat by limiting heat radiation and conduction.", "Generate a story based on the following three words: spaceship, detective, choir", "Find 5 synonyms for the given word.\n\nAmazing", "Generate a joke using the following three words: sarcastic, bicycle, banana", "Given natural language sentences, identify the relations between entities.\n\nSharad and Sayansh are brothers.", "Identify the functions of table columns \"age\" and \"salary\".", "Change a sentence for a more professional tone.\n\nI ain't got no money.", "What are the three common attributes of a narrative poem?", "Generate a list of 5 countries with the highest human development index.", "Research what machine learning frameworks are available for GPT tasks.", "Compose a short two-stanza poem featuring the words \"leaves\" and \"clouds\".", "Design a game for children about saving money.", "Predict the value of y in the following equation: x = y^2 + 4y\n\nx = 9", "Explain the concept of Big Data in layman terms.", "Identify which of the following five items is not a computer programming language.\n\nA.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "Describe the process of transforming data into insights in one sentence.", "What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?", "Generate a valid stock price prediction for Amazon (AMZN).", "Given the dialogue, classify it as an inquiry or a statement.\n\nUser: How do I delete my account?", "Identify the type of relationship between the two given entities.\n\nEntities: Indian Movie and Hollywood Movie", "Describe a virtual reality world that is based in the future.", "Outline the given document into three sections.\n\nA guide to applying for a loan", "Describe a tool used for debugging a program.", "Given a set of eight numbers (1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), generate a sentence that reflects their order.", "Write a query that returns the GDP of a state.", "How do you delete user account in given software?\n\nSoftware: Adobe Photoshop", "Compose a verse of a song.\n\nThe pain of a lost love.", "Explain why loyalty programs have become so important to retailers.", "Create a poetic metaphor that compares the provided person to an object or concept.\n\nA runner", "List three reasons why individuals should recycle plastics.", "Identify which sentence best completes the sentence.\n\nThe International Space Station is the largest structure in space ever constructed by humans and has been continuously occupied since \nA) 1984\nB) 1998\nC) 2002\nD) 2009", "Convert this sentence into third person\n\nI'm going to the store.", "Create an analogy to illustrate the concept of a black hole.", "Suggest a new name for a startup company specialized in pet food.", "Construct a dialogue where you ask a friend to loan you a book and your friend responds negatively.", "Please provide a psychology definition of memory.", "Combine the following two sentences using an appropriate conjuction\n\nShe was scared.

Four genes with potentially pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNV) were detected in three cell lines. SNV were also detected in seventeen HL-related genes and three mitosis-related genes. Copy number variants were detected in four HL-related genes in all five cell lines. Given the high degree of aneuploidy in HL, mitosis-related genes were screened for defects. One mitotic gene (NCAPD2) was amplified in all five HL cell lines, and two genes (FAM190A, PLK4) were amplified in four cell lines.

The proposed algorithm is a reimplementation of deep deterministic policy gradient with a continuous action space, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to map frames of the game to the expected action. The experiments conducted with two variants of the Doom game showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline solution in terms of accuracy, demonstrating superior performance with deeper CNNs.\n\nThis research demonstrates the feasibility of deep reinforcement learning for game AI. With the help of deep learning techniques, our model is able to apprehend abstract concepts and perform complex navigational tasks, ensuring a high accuracy compared to the traditional approach. Exploring the performance of other deep reinforcement learning algorithms on the Doom games could further improve the overall accuracy.\n\nThe applications of the proposed approach can extend beyond game AI to robotic navigation and control tasks, image processing, and decision-making. By embracing more complex reinforcement learning techniques, such as imitation learning, hierarchical learning and meta-learning, the proposed method can be applied in various AI-driven tasks, including robotics and healthcare, combat and autonomous driving.", "Fill in the <mask> with a word related to babies", "Output a list of a different kind of fruits", "Make the following sentence less formal.\n\nIt is impossible to fathom the depths of his understanding.", "Find the name of the tallest mountain in the world.", "Create a list of five questions to ask a potential job candidate.", "Rank the given items from most complex to least complex.\n\nCrocodile, turtle, snake", "Generate a 4-word proverb.", "Generate example sentences for the phrase: \"never give up\".", "List five machines used in the kitchen.", "Congolese culture is heavily influenced by which antropological phenomenon?", "Write a report on the benefits of living a healthier lifestyle.", "Name three important events in world history from the last century.", "Describe the process of photosythesis using simple language.", "List three tools that are used in data analysis.", "Generate a list of all the words in the sentence except the conjunctions.\n\nJohn and I were having lunch together.", "Generate a statement of purpose focused on computer engineering.", "Summarize the our goals with GPT model in no more than 8 words.", "What is the most effective way to monetize a website?", "Describe a horror movie about a haunted house in two sentences.", "Construct five questions given the following topic.\n\nMachine learning", "Given some text and a keyword, find the synonyms of the keyword in the text.\n\nThe fox is a small furry animal.\nAnimal", "Write a persuasive argument on why the given activity should be implemented.\n\nProviding free internet access to all people.", "Provide two examples of an action that the GPT model cannot perform.", "Which of the following sentences is correct?\n\nHe goed to the store.\nHe went to the store.", "Analyze the following tweet and classify it as positive or negative sentiment.\n\nJust spent an amazing morning at the beach playing frisbee with friends #SummerVibes", "What is the formula to calculate speed?", "Make an argument for reducing plastic waste.", "I need to change the font size of my document - explain how to do it", "Convert the following digital time to words.\n\n22:45", "Given some code and output, explain the syntax and meaning of each line.\n\na = 2\nb = 3\nprint(a * b)", "Look up the facts about a famous historical figure and summarize it.\n\nWinston Churchill.", "Write a blog post on the benefits of electric cars.", "Create a function in Java that takes array of integers and checks if it contains duplicates.", "Explain why deep neural networks are particularly useful for natural language understanding.", "Generate an excerpt of dialogue related to a complex problem.", "Suggest an AI research topic.", "Suggest two actions that citizens can take to reduce their carbon footprint.", "Write JavaScript code that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a copy of the array without any of the duplicate numbers.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4]", "Write 2-3 sentences about the importance of running.", "Describe in general terms what happens in the first days after someone gets infected with Covid-19.", "Classify the given input sentence in 4 classes.\n\nI bought a new phone", "Come up with a process that should be followed to program a robot.", "Construct a timeline for a new social media launch.", "Describe the life cycle of a product", "Suggest a healthy breakfast recipe for a busy morning.", "Come up with three product features that a digital assistant should have.", "Remember a detail from the following story.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a big castle in a small village.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "Provide suggestions on how to make a website more accessible.", "Describe the cultural implications of a two party political system.", "Create an original metaphor", "List 4 types of data storage", "List five different advantages of living on Mars.", "Generate an email to the customer service team of a product delivery app outlining a user experience issue.\n\nA user had problems with the product delivery.", "Which day is the two hundred thirty second day of the year?", "Divide the following numbers into two sets: 3, 5, 7, 11", "Design a 5 step process to understand the customer needs", "Name two commodities traded in the Forex market.", "Develop a marketing strategy for a gift shop", "Rewrite the following sentence using different vocabulary to keep the same meaning.\n\nThis cooking pot is very large.", "Generate a list of 3-5 popular dishes from India.", "What language is this sentence written in?\n\nJe suis \u00e0 la recherche d'un nouvel emploi.", "Rewrite the following passage with different words and yet still convey the same message.\n\nThe car was moving too fast and caused an accident.", "Given a news article and its categories, generate 2 questions that could be used to discuss the news article.\n\nNews Article: Doha, Qatar (CNN) \u2014 On the eve of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA President Gianni Infantino launched a tirade against Western critics of the controversial tournament in an explosive hour-long monologue.\n\nCategories: Sports, Politics, Soccer, World News", "Using the following data, calculate the median age\n\n11, 13, 14, 13, 15", "Generate a list of five creative gifts for a seven-year-old.", "Describe what led to the current international climate", "List the advantages of electric cars over traditional gasoline cars.", "What is the third largest country in the world in terms of area?", "Determine a more efficient way to access data from the given model.\n\nModel: A list of dictionaries", "Describe the concept of free will.", "Select one word from the phrase and generate a complex sentence.\n\n\"She always studied hard\"", "Provide a list of five animals that are classified as primates.", "Write a review for a book you read last month.\n\nI recently read \"The Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins.", "Think of a catchy slogan for a company.\n\nCompany: Internet Security Service", "Generate a fill in the blank lyrics for a rap song.", "Find the difference between 10am and 8pm?", "Take the given text and modify it to make it more interesting.\n\nIt was a sunny day.", "Find the correct order.\n\n1.

It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data or information is numerous as for example a time series.[2]\n\nIt is also the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. It is related to infographics and scientific visualization. One distinction is that it's information visualization when the spatial representation (e.g., the page layout of a graphic design) is chosen, whereas it's scientific visualization when the spatial representation is given.[3]\n\nFrom an academic point of view, this representation can be considered as a mapping between the original data (usually numerical) and graphic elements[4] (for example, lines or points in a chart). The mapping determines how the attributes of these elements vary according to the data. In this light, a bar chart is a mapping of the length of a bar to a magnitude of a variable. Since the graphic design of the mapping can adversely affect the readability of a chart,[2] mapping is a core competency of Data visualization.[5]\n\nData and information visualization has its roots in the field of statistics, as early as the 18th century,[6] and is therefore generally considered a branch of descriptive statistics. However, because both design skills and statistical and computing skills are required to visualize effectively, it is argued by authors such as Gershon and Page that it is both an art and a science.[5]\n\nResearch into how people read and misread various types of visualizations is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most understandable and effective in conveying information.[7][8]", "Analyze this sentence: She didn't shop because she was too tired\n\n\u201cShe didn't shop because she was too tired.\u201d", "Come up with a comparison between a candle and a river.", "How does the use of AI influence the way businesses operate?
